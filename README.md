# Honey Template

Aragon DAO Template for continuous issuance and bottom up fund allocation. Used as the base for Honey, 1Hive's community currency. 

## Local deployment

This template depends on a number of yet to be published apps, so to develop locally you must deploy those applications first.

*  Conviction Voting (Latest version with hooks)
*  Hooked Token Manager (Latest version)
*  Dandelion Voting (Latest version with hooks)
*  Tollgate
*  Issuance
